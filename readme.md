# Books JSON

## Collection of Various Books in JSON Format

Most of these books fall into the broad categories of business, psychology, programming and technical topics.

The main purpose of this repo is to have some ready to go json data to use in developing Node.js or Python programs. Some of this data has also been loaded into a MongoDB collection at mongolabs.

This makes it relatively straight-forward to write scripts using Node.js, npm and the MongoDB or Mongoose packages, or Python, pip and the pymongo library for MongoDB.

**Sample JSON data format**

	{
    	"title" : "Raspberry Pi User Guide",
    	"index_code" : "Raspberry Pi",
    	"year_published" : 2016,
    	"number_pages" : 293,
    	"time_stamp" : "2017-08-29",
    	"tags" : ["Raspberry Pi", "RPi", "Linux", "Open Source"]
    }
