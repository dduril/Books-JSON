# Books JSON

## Collection of technical and programming books in json format

The main purpose of this repo is to have some ready to go json data to use in developing Node.js or Python programs. This data has also been loaded into mongolabs as a MongoDB collection of documents.

This makes it relatively straight-forward to write scripts using Node.js, npm and the MongoDB or Mongoose packages, or Python, pip and the pymongo library for MongoDB.
