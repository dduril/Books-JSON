## Books JSON

### Collection of Books in JSON Format

Most of these books fall into categories including business, psychology, technology and emerging trends.

### Purpose

Collection of JSON data for use in Node.js, JavaScript, and Python programs. Some of this data has also been loaded into a MongoDB collection at mongolabs.

This makes it relatively straight-forward when developing code using Node.js, npm, MongoDB or Mongoose packages, Python to fetch and display the JSON data.

**Sample JSON data schema:**

	{
    	"title" : "Raspberry Pi User Guide",
    	"index_code" : "Raspberry Pi",
    	"year_published" : 2016,
    	"number_pages" : 293,
    	"time_stamp" : "2017-08-29",
    	"tags" : ["Raspberry Pi", "RPi", "Linux", "Open Source"]
    }
